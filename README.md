## Tic Tac Toe w/ Typescript & Node JS

Typescript is kind of a secret to me. I've just recently figured it out good and efficient ways to make OOP code. In this project, I'm trying to improve at it.

## Code Efficiency
If you're a huge fan of code efficiency like me, you're not going jump off the chair just yet. This is a beginners level project.  
Nevertheless, I'm trying my best to implement a high functional, easy to read, easy to maintain code.  

## Tic Tac Toe
Why Tic Tac Toe ? Why not any other project ?  
Two reasons:
* Tic Tac Toe is one of my favorite board games, it involves strategy and risk calculation, just like chess, but way easier to understand. Try to teach chess to a 5 year old. Now try to teach Tic Tac Toe to a 5 year old.
* It's such a wonderful code to do, I mean, it requires the user input, it's great to make the coder understand basic principles of import / constant variables, since the userInput shouldn't be changed. It's also really good to train OOP code ( my favorite kind of code ). And for last but not least, the principle of Tic Tac Toe makes a lot of sense while coding. The fact that the user can simply use a for loop to check if the player won makes me wonder if Tic Tac Toe wasn't created by coders ( that's a joke ).

## Code itself
The code as I said, won't be the better one you have ever saw, but I'm trying to improve at typescript, and doing so with a fun project excites me.
